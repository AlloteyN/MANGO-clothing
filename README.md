# MANGO-clothing
Group project I contributed to in order to make a functioning clothing website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and NodeJs
Credits also goes to: Zachary Pandolfi, Ryan Pham, Ali-Reza Rizwani, Devesh Agarwal, and Soham Bose

Description: This website allows users to place orders for different sweatshirts. Once a sweatshirt is selected, the user can enter in order info, and if successful, the information is stored on a MongoDB database that holds all the successful orders on the website.
